## 1. Overview
Image Deduper is a desktop application that processes image files locally on your Windows device. The project does not transmit image content, fingerprints, or settings to remote servers.

## 2. Data Collected
- **Application settings** – Window size, language, and threshold values are stored locally in setting.ini.
- **Logs** – Processing logs are written to files next to the executable.
- **Checkpoints** – Resume data (.loading.json, esume.json) is kept inside the selected source folder.

No personal or analytical data is collected or transmitted by the application or by this GitHub repository.

## 3. Third-Party Components
The app uses libraries provided by Microsoft and SixLabors (see [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)). These components run locally and do not contact external services on their own.

## 4. Distribution via GitHub Releases
Self-contained ZIP packages are published under the repository’s Releases page. Downloading these packages from GitHub is subject to GitHub’s own privacy policy.

## 5. Support & Contact
If you discover an issue related to privacy or data handling, please open an issue in the GitHub repository so it can be addressed publicly and transparently.
